# Basketball Scoreboard With Timer

This project is a digital basketball timer and scoreboard built with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It simulates a basketball game with a 10-minute quarter countdown, and features manual score tracking for both Home and Guest teams.

## Features

- **10-Minute Quarter Timer:** A digital countdown timer that represents a 10-minute basketball quarter.
- **Start, Stop, and Reset Timer:** You can start, stop, and reset the countdown timer.
- **Manual Scoring:** Buttons to manually add 1, 2, or 3 points for both Home and Guest teams.
- **Digital Score Display:** Displays the current scores for both teams in a digital format.
- **Separate Scoring for Home and Guest:** Different score buttons for each team to track their individual scores.

## How It Works

1. **Timer:**
   - The timer counts down from 10 minutes (600 seconds) for each quarter.
   - You can start, stop, and reset the countdown at any time.
   
2. **Scoring:**
   - Each team (Home and Guest) has separate buttons to add 1, 2, or 3 points to their respective scores.
   - The total score for each team is displayed in a digital scoreboard format.
